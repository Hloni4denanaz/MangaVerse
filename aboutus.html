        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>At MangaVerse, our story began with a simple passion: a love for captivating stories
        and stunning art from across Asia. Founded in 2020 by a group of manga, manhwa, and 
        web novel enthusiasts, we started as a small online store dedicated to sharing our favorite
        titles with fellow fans. Over the years, our community has grown, and so has our collection—now
        featuring hundreds of officially licensed series from Japan, Korea, China, and indie creators worldwide.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is to connect readers with the stories they love while 
supporting the creators who bring them to life. We aim to provide a diverse, high-quality selection of manga, 
manhwa, and web novels that cater to every kind of reader—whether you're looking for timeless classics, the 
latest releases, or niche genres.</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>We envision MangaVerse as more than just a store—it's a community hub for passionate readers and collectors.
 We're committed to becoming the go-to platform for discovering, discussing, and enjoying the best in 
 illustrated storytelling, while promoting creativity, inclusivity, and global fandom culture.</p>

<p>Join us on our journey and explore new worlds—one volume at a time.</p>
